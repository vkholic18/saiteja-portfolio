Joined KPMG as a Python Developer and quickly adapted to challenging environments. My role primarily focused on backend development, where I successfully restructured the complete backend for an internal application. This involved optimizing code, improving application performance, and ensuring scalability. Additionally, I transitioned seamlessly into a client project after mastering Apache Spark, effectively managing project deliverables and maintaining productive communication with clients.

Key accomplishments over the appraisal period include earning three industry-recognized certifications related to cloud and data engineering. I also completed a rigorous 64-hour data engineering certification program, which enhanced my knowledge and practical skills significantly. Through these achievements, I contributed directly to the quality and efficiency of project deliveries.

In terms of personal and professional growth, I invested in continuous learning and development. Accumulating over 120 hours of learning, including all mandatory trainings, I was recognized as the "Top Learner" in the DT TRA team. My dedication to self-improvement extended to mastering trending technologies that are crucial in the industry.

Beyond technical work, I provided leadership and mentorship within the team. I guided junior developers, instilling best practices for writing clean and efficient code, and conducted interviews to assess and onboard potential team members. This mentorship contributed to the overall productivity and skill development of our team.

My operational excellence is reflected in my ability to consistently fill timesheets without defaults and deliver all project milestones on time. This reliability and commitment to organizational goals were supported by my proactive approach to resolving challenges and adapting to new requirements. Furthermore, I maintained effective client interactions, which resulted in meeting and often exceeding their expectations.

Considering my comprehensive contributions in technical expertise, learning, certifications, leadership, and consistent delivery, I confidently rate myself as a **Top Performer (Level 1)**. My focus remains on achieving excellence, learning continuously, and contributing effectively to team success.
